rqPen 2.1 (Release date: 2019-05-01)
* Fixed bug in the lp algorithm for group penalties.
* Switched from using fnb to br algorithm as the default for big data problems.
* Updated rq.lasso.fit to give an error message if only one predictor is provided. 
* Updated cross-validation to correctly use weights. 
* Made changes to improve performance of QICD algorithm.
* Updated cv.rq.pen to work with QICD algorithm. 

rqPen 2.0 (Release date: 2017-05-16)
* Added function qaSIS, for quantile adaptive screening. 
* Major changes to fix bugs in rq.group.fit and cv.rq.group.pen
* Added option (penGroups) to penalize only a subset of groups. 
* Updated rq.lasso.fit to choose method of "br" or "fn" based on combination of n and p. 
* Fixed bug so you can now use weights with cv.rq.pen. Thanks to Matt Goldman for finding the bug. 

rqPen 1.5.1 (Release date: 2016-11-03)
* Fixed bug in model_eval function, replaced fits-test_y with test_y-fits. The order matters for the check function, because it is not symmetric. 

rqPen 1.5 (Release date: 2016-10-21)

* Updated group penalty to use QICD algorithm 

rqPen 1.4 (Release date: 2016-04-20)
==============
Changes: 

* Introduced penVars, which allows users to select a subset of variables to be penalized.
* QICD algorithm implemented for rq.nc.fit and is default if p > 50. 
* QICD algorithm has not been implemented for group penalties, yet. 

rqPen 1.3 (Release date: 2016-02-08)
==============
Changes:

* Fixed bug that caused cv.rq.pen to be doing k-folds cross validation incorrectly.  
* QICD approach should be considered in work. Future updates will include a more vetted and faster algorithm.

rqPen 1.2 (Release date: 2015-10-13)
==============
Changes:

* Added group penalty function with two implementations. QICD, a coordinate descent approach, and a linear programming approach.
* New functions for group penalties include: groupQICD, groupQICDMultLambda and nonzero
* Added coefficient functions for cv.rq.group.pen and cv.rq.pen
* Added kernel based weight functions kernel_estimates and kernel_weights. These will be for future implementations that use inverse weighting as an approach for handling missing data.

rqPen 1.1 (Release date: 2015-03-15)
==============

Changes:

* Corrected errors in SCAD and MCP penalties
* Combined scad_1_deriv and scad_2_deriv into one function scad_deriv
* swapped order of weights and lambda in functions rq.lasso.fit, rq.nc.fit and cv.rq.pen


rqPen 1.0 (Release date: 2014-10-29)
